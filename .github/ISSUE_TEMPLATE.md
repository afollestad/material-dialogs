(`[x]` becomes a filled in checkbox, `[ ]` is an empty one)

- [ ] *I understand that dialogs which require a combination of different dialog types provided by this library (e.g. list + progress, input + checkbox) require a **custom view**.*
- [ ] I have verified there are [no duplicate active or recent bugs, questions, or requests](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
- [ ] I have verified that I am using the latest version of Material Dialogs.
- [ ] I have given my issue a non-generic title.
- [ ] I have [read over the documentation](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs/blob/master/README.md) (before asking questions on how to do something).
